            <!-- Objective -->
            As a current Master’s student in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, I’m passionate about transforming complex ideas into impactful, real-world solutions. 
            My academic journey has allowed me to explore areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent systems, and I’m eager to apply this knowledge in ways that solve meaningful problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in environments that encourage experimentation and innovation, especially when working on projects that push the boundaries of how AI can be integrated into everyday life. 
            Whether it’s designing adaptive algorithms, building interactive applications, or collaborating with a diverse team of thinkers, my goal is to contribute to solutions that are both technically sound and human-centered.
