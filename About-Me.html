            I'm Dierra, a graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. 
            I enjoy exploring new technologies and building projects, and I’m constantly learning and growing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m motivated by solving challenging problems and using technology to create meaningful results. 
            I enjoy experimenting with personal projects and applying what I learn in practical ways. 
            Outside of schoolwork and coding projects, I spend time on my hobbies, which help me stay balanced, creative, and inspired.

            As a Master’s student in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, I’m passionate about exploring new ideas and learning how to apply them effectively. 
            My academic journey has introduced me to areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent systems, and I’m eager to continue building my skills through hands-on projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in environments that encourage experimentation and creativity. 
            Whether it’s designing small algorithms, building interactive applications, or collaborating with classmates on challenging problems, my goal is to grow as a developer while creating projects that are both technically solid and meaningful to me.

           <p>
           I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Kennesaw State University, complemented by a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics. 
           My undergraduate studies gave me a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making.
            </p>
          <p>
            During this time, I discovered a deeper passion for mathematics, technology, and the ways in which data can power intelligent systems. 
            That realization inspired me to shift my academic focus toward computer science and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, where I’m building expertise in areas such as machine learning, algorithm design, and intelligent systems development. 
            I am on track to graduate in December 2026 and look forward to applying my interdisciplinary background to complex, real-world challenges.
