            <!-- Objective -->
            As a current Master’s student in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, I’m passionate about transforming complex ideas into impactful, real-world solutions. 
            My academic journey has allowed me to explore areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and intelligent systems, and I’m eager to apply this knowledge in ways that solve meaningful problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive in environments that encourage experimentation and innovation, especially when working on projects that push the boundaries of how AI can be integrated into everyday life. 
            Whether it’s designing adaptive algorithms, building interactive applications, or collaborating with a diverse team of thinkers, my goal is to contribute to solutions that are both technically sound and human-centered.

           <p>
           I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Kennesaw State University, complemented by a minor in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics. 
           My undergraduate studies gave me a strong foundation in quantitative analysis, problem-solving, and data-driven decision-making.
            </p>
          <p>
            During this time, I discovered a deeper passion for mathematics, technology, and the ways in which data can power intelligent systems. 
            That realization inspired me to shift my academic focus toward computer science and artificial intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence, where I’m building expertise in areas such as machine learning, algorithm design, and intelligent systems development. 
            I am on track to graduate in December 2026 and look forward to applying my interdisciplinary background to complex, real-world challenges.
